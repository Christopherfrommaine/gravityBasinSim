This is a gravitational simulation for a large number of particles covering the screen.
It is largely based on recreating this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LavXSS5Xtbg&pp=ygUFMnN3YXA%3D
which explores the complexity and chaos of where a particle in a gravitational system will end up.

See ./Images/Animations/ for some example videos of what I've been able to create with this.

Although it uses numpy and a few optimizations, it is very slow. In the future, I plan on implementing GPU paralellization,
and I may switch what language I use to improve performance.
